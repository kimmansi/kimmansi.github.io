                                        </span><strong>So some things to know.</strong>
										<blockquote> It took me a while to find my way to this field. I went to school for Business Logistics
                                        and spent a career as store manager for big box retailers like Target, Barnes & Noble, and Coldwater Creek, leading teams of over 200 people at times.
                                        I've been an online seller as well for years. Common thread through everything was my love of working with people and helping them find their way from 
                                        point A to point B whether that was my customers or people on my team. I also always loved bringing order to chaos, which in sales and retail there's lots
                                        of that to tame.</blockquote>

                                        <blockquote>The other common thread through my career was I always understood the power of visuals in driving the success of a business. I took any position that allowed me exposure to visual merchandising, marketing, 
                                        and graphic design. I've also done some form of art my whole life. I drew portraits for years, dabbled in pastels, did a course with Moravian Tileworks and got into working with clay and sculpture for awhile, and lately I've been playing 
                                        with tattoo design, especially handdrawn typography which I'm especially drawn to. My first project was my husband's first tattoo memorializing our
                                        dog of 18 years who passed a couple years ago. So I love working with anything visual that influences business.</blockquote>
                                        
                                        <blockquote>But I've always had hints that maybe technology was for me. My husband, who is a computer and network engineer, talks alot about his job and while
                                        my eyes may glaze over occasionally, I can usually keep up with what he's talking about. In my jobs, I was also always tapped to fix store POS systems or malfunctioning
                                        computer programs when they flaked at my stores. Ask me sometime about having to wade into a monster cable management situation I inherited on a server that had pushed 
                                        it six feet away from a wall! So everyone knew I was comfortable dealing with tech even if I wasn't technically in tech. </blockquote>
                                        
                                        <blockquote>So now I find myself here, starting a brand new career. Because like many people, I got waylaid by a lot of life changes that hit me all at once. I had family getting sick and needing care. I had 
                                        family pass away leaving me feeling kind of lost in my life. The company that I worked for and loved going bankrupt...and me realizing that I had been working in a field 
                                        that I thought I was passionate about but actually wasn't. So I found myself in a front end developer bootcamp. I had never before done more HTML than 
                                        changing a word to bold or centering a paragraph in an eBay listing description. But I suddenly fell in love with coding. And realized that I could combine my new love with my old love of visual design
                                        and actually find a calling that I feel passionate about.</blockquote>
                                        
                                        <blockquote>I'm currently working on expanding my JavaScript experience. And have dipped a toe into Bootstrap and Angular. I also want to focus on 
                                        some back end programming. And I recently set up shop on Fiverr for graphic design, logos, web design, and branding. I do appreciate you though for taking time to check out my work and read my story. I hope what you read 
                                        here inspires you to message me to talk about how we can partner together for your business. I've been in retail, I've been in non-profits, I've owned businesses.
                                        And I bring that perspective now to address whatever your technology needs are for your business. Thanks so much for your time!</blockquote>
