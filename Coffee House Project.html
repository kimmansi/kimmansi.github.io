                                    <h2></h2>            
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/WgqqTxh/process-moodboard.png" alt="Moodboard" />
                                        </span><strong>The moodboard.</strong>
										This client makes hand-crafted artisan coffee and espresso drinks. They wanted a sleek look but also one that presented
                                        warmth as community support and outreach was important to them. They wanted everyone surrounding them to see them as a 
                                        true center for hospitality, togetherness, and a great cup of coffee. I researched their competitors and all but one had websites and 
                                        branding that had black backgrounds with very industrial vibes. So I endeavored to give Cup of Love the exact opposite feel, on of warmth 
                                        and closeness. Instead of going for black or brown, i pulled a deep eggplant color out of the undertones from actual coffee beans. To compliment that, I chose
                                        a complimentary color of a soft orange. The red accents were on the nose for hearts but when I found the hearts picture with all those
                                        super saturated colors on the eggplant purple background, I knew that red worked very well with my other chosen colors. And then white and soft dove gray for accent colors. All the pics were chosen for their warm feelings they evoked. And the Monterrat 
                                        font helped balance everything as was very crisp looking while also invoking lettering you would see on actual signs.   </p>
										<br>
										<br>
										
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/c8hjfy6/Process-Logo.png" alt="Logo" /></span><strong>The logo.</strong>
										The name in this case did dictate the logo. But I very deliberately chose the soft orange to use on the cup to help balance 
                                        the heart theme. And in the second iteration of the logo I took out the hearts and made a graphic with coffee beans to represent them
                                        instead. I chose an half elipse shape to visually indicate an old time hanging shop plackard sign. And I added a stenciled almost faded 
                                        font for the Est date and (made me laugh) Fa-Brew-Lous label. It just made the logo fun. And I think helps make the coffee house even more 
                                        on brief for the warm and welcoming element that they wanted to present to the community. </p>
										<br>
										<br>
										
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/TRSCVGh/screencapture-miro.png" alt="Sitemap" /></span><strong>The sitemap.</strong> 
										The main feature of the sitemap had to be an Order function as the coffee house had just debuted an online ordering app. They also have a 
                                        significant offering of coffee related accessories and gifts along with their retail bagged offerings. So I also wanted to have an additional focus
                                        on a Shop function. And given their community outreach and hub focus, I also wanted to give them space on the website to feature all their social 
                                        media, events, and community happenings that they were involved with. I also knew with the ordering functions, we would need a log in page. And also 
                                        locations, hours, and a membership/email CTA. I also wanted to give them a detailed about us page but I later planned that in with their Meet community page.
                                        It just made more sense for them to tell their story alongside featuring all their community events. </p>

                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/9G4cCDn/Process-Wireframe-Sketch.png" alt="Wireframe Sketches" /></span><strong>The wireframe sketches. </strong>I spent a lot of time 
                                        planning out the main page for mobile as I knew the Order, Shop, and Meet section would need to exist in a horizontal row on a full screen laptop or console. 
                                        I also sketched out text areas that included buttons for whatever function each section did. I planned a verticle scroll for all the horizontal menu scroll 
                                        galleries. And I also added a scroll gallery for the social media section. 
                                    </p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/6J5nCNy/Process-Wireframe.png" alt="Low Fi Wireframe" /></span><strong>The low fidelity wireframes.</strong>Everything I planned out in 
                                        sketches translated well to lo-fi wireframes in Figma. Just played a little with button size to refine how they would compare to other elements. Also added
                                        in some different gray fill in colors to help start making final decisions as to where the purple vs the orange colors would go. I ultimately decided to
                                        go with the eggplant purple as my primary background color. </p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/6vHqvvR/Process-Prototype.png" alt="Prototype" /></span><strong>The prototype.</strong> 
										The prototype came out remarkably like my original wireframe sketches without too many changes. As I was adding in connections, I realized that the 
                                        as designed the menu would be awkward to use. So I changed it and added in a traditional board menu. I also finalized what animations I would be
                                        adding into the final design to make the website fun for users. I added an animated hamburger menu and a slide in sidenav. I added hover featured to
                                        help navigate users through the site. I also created mockups of branded product so users could get a better idea of how the would actually look when 
                                        fully up. </p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/RB4tc8F/Process-Responsive-Testing.png"  alt="Responsive Testing" /></span><strong>Is it responsive? </strong>I struggled a bit
                                        to get the table and mobile widths to work for the navigation to be responsive. But all the other elements worked well on different screens.</p>
									<br>
									<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/VCsQM6Q/process-website.png"  alt="Cup of Love Website" /></span><strong>The final website.</strong> 
										You can view the website for Cup of Love Coffee House <a href="#">here.</a>
										In the end, the major design change that I had to make was in regards to the logo. The background of the original logo design was just very challenging
                                        to work with for the navigation menu although looked great for the footer. I also felt there was not enough white or negative space for relief from
                                        all the color I used on the page. I felt it looked kind of dated. So I retooled the logo to have a less graphic and more handmade look and also got rid
                                        of the soft orange in the header in favor of white for the background. It gave the page a cleaner and more modern look while still maintaining that 
                                        warm community vibe.</p>
