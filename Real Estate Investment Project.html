                                    <h2></h2>            
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YDpXHnh/DI-Moodboard.png" alt="Moodboard" />
                                        </span><strong>The moodboard.</strong>
										This client's colors were fuscia pink and black from the beginning as they were already used heavily in their brand. They also 
										had strong meaning and imagery behind the choice of those colors. So moodboarding was more about finding what other images not
										only fit their color branding but also gave us some other words to associate with their mission. I found a sign that had "grit"
										used as an acronym that I liked. But I also liked the colors the artist used. There was a faded purple gray color that I thought
										might be a good middle hue color to ground the hot pink but also soften the black power color. I also researched the local market and 
										their competitors to see what colors and imagery they presented. In a sea of blue, green, and yellow, the pink and black would definitely 
										stand out. But I had to make sure they presented as much solid, trustworthy, and dependable as much as they yelled dynamic and differnt. 
                                        I also started looking at block type fonts as I knew I wanted the DIVINE part of the name all in caps. And I originally thought to change
										the feel of "investments" by using a script since the company was trying to attract clients that otherwise might find an investment company	
										hard to approach.  </p>
										<br>
										<br>
										
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/JnDGZ8D/DI-Logos.png" alt="Logo" /></span><strong>The logo.</strong>
										I did three iterations of this logo. First playing with background colors. Then narrowing down imagery. And then finally deciding that the pink
										needed two solid but complimentary block fonts to balance instead of using a script one. I did custom graphics for all the buildings. And I chose to
										highlight homes and buildings because the company while offering other products, most definitely concentrated on real estate as a means for people
										to grow wealth. I did the house design with the empty home progressing to the home full of lines to represent the growth of the company and also the 
										of the client's portfolio if they signed up with DI. I also did a skyline design with a gradual increasing height of buildings with the solid square 
										of strength representing DI in the middle to signify the growth they could bring to a portfolio. And the two windows, one dark and other light and higher
										up to also represent that as well. The pink triangle was also an element that important to the original brand concept and mission statement of the company.
										I still kept it but this time rather than a logo shape border element, I used it to bring attention to the Divine name and also as the entry point to the 
										line element building drawings.</p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fQy0Jc3/screencapture-miro-353x326.png" alt="Sitemap" /></span><strong>The sitemap.</strong> 
										This was a complicated sitemap to plan out. The product page would have several ways to search several different products. So pages linking to 
										pages, linking back to pages. I also had to decide if we were going to include the outside functions and social media workshops on the site as well. 
										I did decide that the community event offerings and education opportunities were inherent to their brand, so they did belong on the website.  </p>
										<br>
										<br>
                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/9G4cCDn/Process-Wireframe-Sketch.png" alt="Wireframe Sketches" /></span><strong>The wireframe sketches.</strong>
										There was going to be a lot of elements to these pages. A lot of custom graphics, info graphics, and big search elements along with a need for picture 
										galleries for all the properties. So I spent time really trying to get an idea of flow. 
                                    </p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/ts1G3rx/DI-Lofi-Frames.png" alt="Low Fi Wireframe" /></span><strong>The low fidelity wireframes.</strong>Everything I planned out in 
                                        sketches translated well to lo-fi wireframes in Figma. Just played a little with button size to refine how they would compare to other elements. Also added
                                        in some different gray fill in colors to help start making final decisions as to how all the different custom graphics would play together. I ultimately decided to
                                        go with the eggplant purple as my primary background color. </p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/syg7nVS/DI-Figma-protoype.png" alt="Prototype" /></span><strong>The prototype.</strong> 
										The prototype came out remarkably like my original wireframe sketches without too many changes. I mainly found that I had to adapt the main page and about me page most. 
										Surprising to me the product page, which was the most complicated out of them all, stayed pretty true to the original sketch.  </p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/MhqLzD6/DI-Responsive.png"  alt="Responsive Testing" /></span><strong>Is it responsive? </strong>
										Due to all the custom graphics, I struggled a bit to get everything responsive at all device widths. </p>

										I am most proud of the JavaScript tab search function that I was able to design and implement for same page tab cycling through
										the various products available.
