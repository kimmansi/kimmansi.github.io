									<blockquote>All my steps from moodboarding to logo creation. Then wireframing to prototyping. And then coding the website.  </blockquote>
									<hr></hr>
                                    <h2></h2>            
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/W6v5Jt4/pp-moodboard.png" alt="Moodboard" />
                                        </span><strong>The moodboard.</strong>
										The first time I sat down and tried to find pictures, typography, and colors for my own website and brand, I accumulated 8 pages of images and 
										color swatches. I have so many interests. And while I love color, I gravitate towards dark and moody for my personal style. So this was an exercise
										of true self discovery. Also helped me iron out how I would help clients better figure out their brand when they are starting from square one. After
										I accumulated all my images, I started sorting them into themes...whimsical, dark, lush, etc. And then I was able to more clearly see color stories emerging.
										My only problem was that I had four distinct very different color themes to choose from now. I ultimately chose inspiration from a fantastic art line
										typography "M" that I found. I knew I wanted to include it somehow in my name. So I decided to basically scribble a bunch of Ms in all the colors
										I had generated for myself. I started editing colors out as I was seeing what was working and what wasn't. And that's how I ended up with my five colors.
										I also picked a kind of handlettered feel font at the time as I thought it expressed me well. I later went for a block font though to give clean license
										to balance the crazy lettering.
									</p>
										<br>
										<br>
										
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/0sCMm69/pp-logo.png" alt="Logo" /></span><strong>The logo.</strong>
										I definitely gravitate to what I call bruise colors -black, blue, and purple. So I knew I wanted the background to have color and I knew I wanted it to
										be one of those. My first impulse was to use black. But the colors of the scribble Ms just begged for lighter color to offset them. So I ended up on 
										that cerulean blue. It was from my "lush" moodboard, where it found it's way into every picture I chose for that board. So my brain was telling me to used
										it. I did do four iterations of this logo, mainly playing with the Ms and how they aligned. The two that were frontrunners basically had two differences:
										one had the Ms in a clean outer edge to the letters and arranged like an algebraic squared variable...and the other had a the more wild scribbled Ms with 
										the smaller one perilously balanced at a tilt on the other. I utltimately chose that latter design as I thought it really balanced the very clean 
										lines of the rest of the logo. And it spoke to the controlled chaos that is my brain. </p>
										<br>
										<br>
										
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/TRSCVGh/screencapture-miro.png" alt="Sitemap" /></span><strong>The sitemap.</strong> 
										I knew I would want to include a lot of custom graphic design elements in my sites so I also knew I would want to feature them on my personal site or
										portfolio. So I gravitated towards a tile format where I could load a lot of visuals in but still present a clean and organized look. I also chose to use
										my pallette to carry though all the pages. And I made a fun numbered ticket graphic to visually color code and number my portfolio catergories for viewing. </p>
										<br>
										<br>

                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/9G4cCDn/Process-Wireframe-Sketch.png" alt="Wireframe Sketches" /></span><strong>The wireframe sketch.</strong> 
										Since I was going to do the tile format, I didn't really spend a lot of time on sketches. I mainly planned out how many tiles would look good and
										in what formation on the mobile site and also the desktop. </p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gzY0znP/PP-Lofi-Main.png" alt="Low Fi Wireframe" /></span><strong>The low fidelity wireframe.</strong> 
										Here I did start more carefully planning my elements and how the pages would link up to one another. I also started planning for some of the animations
										I wanted to include, including a top line nav menu that emerges from a more artisticly styled hamburger menu button. </p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/3r9ggBs/PP-Prototype.png" alt="Prototype" /></span><strong>The prototype.</strong> 
										When I made this prototype, I still didn't have a lot of graphics or projects to pull from to fill all my feature tiles. So I just filled in empty
										spots with some of my colors from my pallette to get an idea of how things would look once filled. I realized then that I was going to have to DI-Logo-Canva-Revised
										some of my tiles blank anyway or reduce opacity to my images when I did start to fill it with project images. It was just going to be too busy for the every
										otherwise. But I still loved the design and didn't change much from my original wireframe plans.  </p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/tMwNqyk/PP-Responsive.png"  alt="Responsive Testing" /></span><strong>Testing for responsiveness.</strong> 
										This project was the easiest to plan for mobile first responsiveness. All the tile elements just flowed beautifully no matter what size the screen 
										was. The nav bar was more of a challenge but a later JavaScript project gave me an idea of how to fix things later on then. </p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/JmsKqTx/PP-Website.png"  alt="Personal Website" /></span><strong>The final website.</strong> 
										
										This one is still a work in progress. I am excited to finish it very soon. In the meantime, I am using the great template that you are currently 
										viewing to build this temporary portfolio site. And as I complete my personal website, this design project will finally come to life.</p>
